I am a PhD student in the Inria Scool team at Cristal, where I work under the supervision of Emilie Kaufmann and Rémy Degenne. Before that, I was a student at the ENS Paris-Saclay and the MVA Master's program.

I am particularly interested in identification problems in Multi-Armed Bandits and Reinforcement Learning. I like to craft algorithms that work with small sample-size for pure exploration problems, and that match the information lower bound for them.

Beyond that, I enjoy learning about statistical testing, sequential testing, safe statistics, and more broadly machine learning.

## Teaching

### Academic year 2024-2025

I am the TA for the "Bases mathématiques" course in the first semester again.

### Academic year 2023-2024

I was the TA for the course "Bases mathématiques" in the first semester, and for the Cryptography course in the second semester for the [mathematics Master's of the Lille University](https://sciences-technologies.univ-lille.fr/mathematiques/formation/master-mention-mathematiques-et-applications/parcours-mfca)
