## News

- **[26-27 October 2023]** I participated to the [RJMI](https://filles-et-maths.fr/rjmi/) at the Inria center of Lille, introducing a group of highschool girls to the world of scientific research, and supervising them as they worked through an open mathematical problem.
- **[October 2023]** I started my PhD about fixed budget best arm identification with [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/) at the Inria center of Lille in the Scool team.
- **[Spring and summer 2023]** I conducted my final Master's internship with [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/) at the Inria center of Lille in the Scool team about best policy identification in average reward RL.

## Teaching

### Academic year 2023-2024

I was the TA for the course "Bases mathématiques" in the first semester, and for the Cryptography course in the second semester for the [mathematics Master's of the Lille University](https://sciences-technologies.univ-lille.fr/mathematiques/formation/master-mention-mathematiques-et-applications/parcours-mfca)
