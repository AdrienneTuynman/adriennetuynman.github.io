I am a PhD student in the [Inria Scool team](https://team.inria.fr/scool/) at [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/), where I work under the supervision of [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) and [Rémy Degenne](https://remydegenne.github.io/). Before that, I was a student at the ENS Paris-Saclay and the MVA Master's program.

I am particularly interested in identification problems in Multi-Armed Bandits and Reinforcement Learning. I like to craft algorithms that work with small sample-size for pure exploration problems, and that match the information lower bound for them.

Beyond that, I enjoy learning about statistical testing, sequential testing, safe statistics, and more broadly machine learning.
